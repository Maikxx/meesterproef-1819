## Introduction

During the master test I worked on a project for [Wallscope](https://wallscope.co.uk/).
Wallscope is a company based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I did this project together with three others: [Chelsea Doeleman](https://github.com/chelseadoeleman), [Jesper Ingels](https://github.com/jesperingels) and [Maikel Sleebos](https://github.com/Senpaizuri).
While working together we all tried to learn something new and fun. Some parts of design process had some overlap, but we each tried to scope our own pieces of the application. What that learning meant for me can be read later on.

During this 5 week period we created an experience which enabled medical students, medical researchers and reporters alike to work together on creating _digital cases_.
These digital cases were formed by searching the Wallscope datasystem, in an intuitive manner, and then group them together in one such case. A case can be a collaboration between multiple users of the system.
Wallscope gets this data from the [NHS](https://www.scot.nhs.uk/), which is the National Healthcare System of Scotland.

To provide the most use out of the system, we also decided not to restrict the basic search functionality behind an _account wall_. If you were to not be logged in, you simply wouldn't be able to participate in any of the _case_ related activities of the platform.

The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Maikxx/360-wallscope).

### Week 1

During the first week we were greeted by Ontero from Wallscope at the UASA.
We did some initial exchaning of ideas and started talking about logistics of our visit to Edinburgh.

I have to say we had the option to work together with UX designers on this project, but this teamwork didn't feel very good from the start, so we decided to separate ways and each do our own.

We unfortunately only had one day to start planning things out, due to the massive public transport strike in the Netherlands that second day.

Besides this, we made it work and went to Edinburgh on wednesday. We had this day and the evenings to do some touristy stuff.

We ofcourse also did some work on thursday and friday. We were greeted by a lot of people from different kinds of companies representing Scotland, including Wallscope itself and the [NHS](https://www.scot.nhs.uk/).
On the first workday we mainly did concepting and project scoping (which we did a poor job of seen afterwards).

Even though most reading this, probably know I don't really like this phase, I still think it is very important to bring a good service to life, which is why I happily participated in the brainstorming processes.
I also did some design research, like the rest of the group on friday, mainly looking at examples of similar systems on Pinterest.
After doing some design research we all decided to take on the challenge to start designing something in Adobe XD. The result of this can be found [here](https://github.com/Maikxx/360-wallscope/blob/master/docs/BRIEFING_1.md).

After us all designing something, we had to give a presentation to the full crowd at the end of the friday, where we presented our findings and first designs.

We unfortunately did not have time to talk with Joost about our progress this week.

### Week 2

During the second week we quickly had a talk with Joost about our concepts for the project.
We pretty much got to hear what we had already thought, which was that the concept was too broad and difficult to really make something fun out of.

We decided to take the route which lead to our current concept at the moment of writing, which is written above. We Skype called Wallscope about this in the afternoon to confirm this concept was still useful for them, which they confirmed it was.

At the start of this week I still focussed on improving that design that was created the week before.
At some point we all decided to start merging things together into one design and to stick with that.
Frankly, it was a mix of a lot of our designs combined into one.

You can find more about these updated designs [here]([here](https://github.com/Maikxx/360-wallscope/blob/master/docs/BRIEFING_3.md)).

Chelsea decided to merge the other designs into hers, since we all thought her designs were the furthest and best.

For the rest of the week I mainly started my technical (lead, which I think is a very stupid thing to name myself but it kind of has some sence to it) role. I started creating the full boilerplate in React, TypeScript and SCSS.
At this point I still thought a little bit about myself too much, which I stubbed my toe on later, since I didn't realize these technologies were not common to everyone.

We collectively decided to continue using React as it was the easiest of the three major frameworks to learn for all.

After building this boilerplate a wild _marshmellow_ occurred (as [Elastique](https://elastique.nl/) likes to call it), since I did not yet think of combining a server into this contraption. Rewriting this was kind of a challenge, which took me pretty much the whole week, while the rest started creating React components.

As the server language I took Node.js wrapped in TypeScript with a PostgreSQL database, since I thought this was best for performance and the database still challenged me enough to learn a lot.

I tried to teach the others some basic structuring things like [these version control guidelines](https://github.com/Maikxx/360-wallscope/blob/master/docs/guidelines/VERSION_CONTROL.md) and some React and TypeScript introductions during this week also.

When I did a talk with Joost, it pretty much confirmed that I already had the WAFS course in the pocket, however that I needed more focus points, mainly for myself to learn. For example, the addition of real-time connectivity if it was possible in context and time, as well as the ability for me to learn something about Unit and End-to-end testing.
